<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-1">1. Consider alternatives</h2>

Account management systems are [hard to build and hard to use](/service-manual/making-software/logins), so consider other ways of giving people access to their data first.

For example, delivery companies often let people track the status of a parcel by entering a unique order number and their email or name.

Alternatively, use the existing [GOV.UK Verify sign-in service](/service-manual/identity-assurance).

---

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-2">2. Don’t make people create an account until they have to</h2> 
Let people use as much of your service as possible before they need to create an account. For example, most shopping cart sites let you browse without having to create an account first. 

If people can avoid creating an account at all -- even better.


---

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-3">3. Use consistent and unambiguous language</h2> 

For consistency with other GOV.UK services, use the phrase ‘Create an account’ on the appropriate screens rather than ‘Register’, ‘Sign-up’ or something else.

Similarly, use labels like ‘Create a username’ and ‘Create a password’ rather than ‘Username’ and ‘Password’, so people understand that they're not being asked to enter existing ones.

---

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-4">4. Use effective signposting</h2> 

Creating an account is rarely a user goal. People come to your service to use it not to create an account -- your calls to action should reflect this.

Make the choice between creating an account and signing in explicit. Presenting the options side by side is not enough -- people will miss one of them or not understand the difference.

If you can, ask people if they’ve used the service before and then direct them to either sign in or create an account.

---

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-5">5. Minimise distractions</h2> 

If users fail to create an account they might not be able to use your service at all. Account creation screens should be about this one task, so strip out any distracting content or links.

---

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-6">6. Help people choose good usernames and passwords</h2>  

Read our guides on creating good [usernames](create-username) and [passwords](create-password).
