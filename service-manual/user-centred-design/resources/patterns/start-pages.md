{:.intro}
All services must have a starting point on GOV.UK, unless they're 'invitation only' services.

Usually (but not always), this will mean asking the GOV.UK content team to create a GOV.UK start page.

Status: [Research required](#research)


Start pages consist of:

1. the name of the service
2. a short introduction
3. a call to action button
4. additional information

<div class="example">
  <div class="inner-block">

    <a href="http://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/examples/start-page">
      <img src="/service-manual/assets/images/design-patterns/start-page.png" alt="Example of a start page" />
    </a>

  </div>
</div>


# Code

There's a [start page template](http://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/examples/start-page) in the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit).

# Guidance


### 1. Service name

The name of the service should tell people what it lets them do and who it's for.

Avoid acronyms and noun phrases. The best service names start with a verb, like "Pay your car tax".



### 2. Short introduction

This should be no more than a few lines.

Focus on things that most users will definitely need to know. For example, costs, or required documents.

Thereâ€™s no need to mention something that people will already know or assume.

Don't try to get across complex eligibility criteria. Instead, deal with these inside the service itself.


### 3. Call to action button

This button text should contain a clear call to action to start the service.

If the service is not hosted on GOV.UK then this should be made clear.


### 4. Additional information

Use this to tell people about other ways that people can access the service.

# Getting a start page on GOV.UK 

Well before your beta launch, [contact the GOV.UK content team](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/).

Tell them:

+ what the service is and who it's for
+ what user needs it addresses
+ eligibility criteria and restrictions
+ what documents or information the user will need to use the service
+ a preview of the service (if available)
+ other methods of applying eg phone and post
+ a demo URL (with a username and password if necessary)
+ when the service is expected to pass its beta assessment

They will either create a start page for you - or if that's not the best way of meeting the user need, recommend another way of joining up your service with the rest of GOV.UK.

Factor in time it'll take for the content to be written and fact-checked -
a start page can only be published after both:

+ the service passes its [beta assessment](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/phases/beta.html) or self-certification
+ the service goes live

# Research

You can help improve this pattern by researching the following:

- how much do people read on these pages?
- positioning of content above or below the button?
- does the button style encourage people to not read?
- what are the most important eligibility requirements to state up front?
- how should start pages be positioned with regards to related guidance?
