{:.intro}
Confirm a user's identity by asking them questions that only you and they know the answers to.


### On this page:

1. [Call it an ‘Identity test’](#section-1)
2. [Make the identity test very easy to use](#section-2)
3. [Don't tell the user which questions they got right or wrong](#section-3)

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-1">1. Call it an ‘Identity test’</h2>

Be honest about the purpose of asking these questions and reassure users by explaining where the data has come from. If you’re using data from someone’s credit history reassure them that their credit rating won’t be affected by the process.

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-2">2. Make the identity test very easy to use</h2>


Write in plain language and stick to one question on each page. 
If you’re naming financial or other institutions, use their commonly known name. 
If you’re asking users to choose from multiple options, expose them as a set of radio buttons rather than hiding them in a drop-down list.

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-3">3. Don't tell users which questions they got right or wrong</h2>

Revealing which answer is wrong allows fraudsters to learn the correct answers through trial and error. For the same reason, don't stop asking questions as soon as the user passes or fails.
