{:.intro}
A confirmation page lets someone know theyâ€™ve completed a transaction and explains to them what will happen next.

# Code

There's a [coded example of this page](http://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/examples/confirmation-page) in the [GOV.UK prototyping kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit).

---

# Guidance

The page should include:

* a reference number (if there is one)
* details of what happens next and when
* contact details for the service
* links to related information and services
* a prompt to give [feedback](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/feedback-pages) on the service
* a way of saving a record of the transaction (eg as a PDF)

---

# Implementation

Some users might bookmark confirmation pages as a form of receipt. Make sure your service responds in a helpful way when they return to the page.

---

# Research

The following areas require further research:

* Where further action is required by the users, should this pattern be used?
* If so, how do we ensure people are aware of those actions?
* If not, what pattern should be used?
