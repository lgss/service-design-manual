<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-1">1. The recommended approach</h2>

We recommend that you:

* choose email address as the primary option
* allow people to create their own username if they don't have or want to use an email address
* help these people choose a unique username by making suggestions
* do not use service-generated usernames for repeat-use services


---

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-2">2. Email addresses as usernames</h2>

Using email addresses as usernames has a number of advantages, but make sure you thoroughly research the users of your service before making it the only option or you may end up excluding people.

### The good:

* they're unique
* for many people they're easy to recall
* it's less cognitive load to use an email than create a username
* it's often a required bit of information anyway

### The bad:

* not everyone has or wants an email address
* some people share an email address (eg older people or carers)
* some people may not remember which email address they used
* people can lose access to their email (eg when they leave school or work)
* they can't be shared in public

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-3">3. Let people create their own username</h2>

Use this option for services with a social element or in combination with the email option.

### The good:

* people don't need an email address to use your service
* people have control -- good if the username will be part of their online identity


### The bad:

* making up a username can be hard for people
* if you're asking for email anyway it's just one more thing for users to do
* easier to forget than an email address


### Tips:

* let people use characters like spaces, or let them know if they can't
* help people who's first choice is already taken by suggesting similar alternatives
* make sure people can retrieve or reset their username if they forget it


---

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-4">4. Create a username for the user</h2>

You can have the service create a username for people from a reference number or similar.
Only use this option for infrequent, short term interactions like checking the status of a transaction.

### The good:

* you can make sure they're unique
* less up-front effort for the user

### The bad:

* computer generated usernames are unlikely to be memorable
* poor user experience as people have to store and retrieve the username from somewhere

### Tips:

* send people their username through some other channel or remind them to write it down
* make sure people can retrieve or reset their username if they forget it

---

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-5">5. Let people change their username</h2>

Some people will wish to change their username. For example
if it's an email address that's no longer available for them
or it reflects a name that they no longer use.

If people will be signing in to your service more than once or twice you should let them change their username or make it easy to migrate to a new account.

Make sure you think through the consequences of people doing this.
