<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-1">1. Use the phrase 'Create a username'</h2>

Use a label like ‘Create a username’ rather than ‘Username’, so people understand that they're being asked to create a new username, not recall an existing one.

Alternatively, if you're using email addresses or phone numbers as usernames, use these as the label.

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-2">2. Explain what the username is for</h2>

The concept of usernames may not be familiar to people with low digital skills or low confidence online.
Help these people by explaining what the username is for and how it will be used.

This also helps people decide on a username. It's particularly important to tell people if their username will be visible to other people, or if it can't be changed.

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-3">3. Try asking for username and password on separate pages</h2>

If your service has users with low digital skills or low confidence online, then consider asking for the username and for the password on separate pages.

In research for GOV.UK Verify we found that:

* people with high digital skills did not notice that the two questions were separated, and completed them easily
* people with low digital skills found the questions much easier when they could concentrate on them one at a time
