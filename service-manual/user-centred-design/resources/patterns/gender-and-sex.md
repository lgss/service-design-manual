<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-1">1. Avoid asking about gender and sex</h2>

Think very carefully before you decide to ask your users about gender or sex.

### You may be breaking the law

Sex is a protected characteristic in the [Equalities Act 2010](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/part/2/chapter/1). Gender isn't, but the closely related concept of gender reassignment is. Treating people differently because of protected characteristics may be discrimination and may therefore be illegal. The act applies to the public sector and to services.


### You may offend or upset your users

Many people consider that questions about gender or sex are sensitive or inappropriate in a government context. 
For people who are coming to terms with differences between their sex and gender, being asked about sex or gender may be particularly difficult and stressful. 

---

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-2">2. Don't say 'sex' when you mean 'gender'</h2>

**Sex** is biologically determined, and can be male, female, or intersex.

**Gender** is a social construct about how people choose to present themselves in the world. 

---

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-3">3. Do not try to infer gender from title</h2>

Trying to guess someone's gender from a title is a bad idea because:

* some titles are not gendered (Dr, Rev, Major)
* title can be changed by deed poll to a title contrary to one's gender/sex

Do not collect title as a required answer, due to the huge variety of titles in use.

---

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-4">4. Allow users to declare an unspecified gender</h2>

Gender is not a clearly defined 'female' or 'male' construct. It can include a range of identities in-between, and labels identifying these identities are still in a state of flux. 

Some people may also be in transition, or move between different genders frequently. This makes it difficult to provide sensible options on a form. 

For a few people, being forced to declare themselves as 'female' or 'male' may lead to dropping out of a form. 


---

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-5">5. Don't assume that 'male' first is the correct order</h2>

Historically, the assumption was that 'men' came before 'women' so the traditional order of options has been 'male first'. This is no-longer appropriate as an automatic assumption.

Please test with 'female' as the first option and [report your findings on the wiki](https://designpatterns.hackpad.com/Gender-and-sex-NHY1Rl0kLD2).


---

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-6">6. Asking about sex instead of gender</h2>

It is only appropriate to ask for someone's sex in a context where the biological data is necessary -- typically, only for medical transactions. Unfortunately, we also have to recognise that we have to deal with legislation that may require 'sex' as a legal identifier.

If you must ask for 'sex' then ask for 'female', 'male' and at least 1 of the remaining options, depending on circumstances:

* female
* male
* unspecified
* intersex
* prefer not to say

### UK
In the UK an [Early Day Motion](http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2014-15/47) has been submitted in support of giving legal recognition to those who do not associate with a particular gender.


### Germany
In Germany, the [Personal Status Law](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/pstg/BJNR012210007.html) (paragraph 22) states that if a child's sex cannot be determined at birth then the law allows for birth to be registered with the 'sex' box left blank.

### Australia
The [Australian Government guidelines on sex and gender](http://www.ag.gov.au/Publications/Pages/AustralianGovernmentGuidelinesontheRecognitionofSexandGender.aspx) specify that when a government form asks about sex or gender, then it must provide these options: M (male), F (female) or X (Indeterminate/Intersex/Unspecified).
