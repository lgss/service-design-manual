<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-1">1. Make the field long enough</h2>

Some email addresses are very long. Your email field should be able to fit at least 95% of email addresses.
Two-thirds of the page width should be enough to do this, but analyse your user data to be sure.

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-2">2. Make it clear why you're asking for someone's email</h2>

An email address is personal data that can easily be abused. Help to reassure users by making it clear what you will and won't do with their address. This will also help users with multiple email addresses choose which one to provide.

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-3">3. Help people to enter their email address correctly</h2>

If a valid email address is required then you should help your users enter it correctly.
The following techniques can help.

### Validate it
Check that what they've entered conforms to the basic email address format.
Check for common typos like 'gnail' instead of 'gmail' ([read a case study here](http://blog.kicksend.com/how-we-decreased-sign-up-confirmation-email-bounces-by-50/)).

### Don't disable paste
Users may have a perfectly good reason for pasting an email address (for example if it's very long).

### Ask for it twice
By doing this you may capture some accidental mis-types. It's not failsafe though -- users can make the same mistake twice, especially if they're typing quickly (or just misremembered their email address).
It also adds additional effort on to your users.

### Play it back
An alternative way of helping users spot a mistyped email address is to play it back to them.
Make sure it's obvious how to correct any errors they might spot.

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-4">4. Check that the user has access to their email account</h2>

If email is an integral part of your service, you can confirm whether the user has access to the email address they give you using an email confirmation loop.
