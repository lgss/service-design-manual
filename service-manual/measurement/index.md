Itâ€™s essential to measure how your service is performing, so you can make sure that your service continues to meet user needs in a cost-effective and efficient way.

Do this by monitoring your metrics. Your metrics are a way to start discussing the strengths and weaknesses of your service, and will help your team to find ways of improving your service over time.

## The 4 KPIs

Your service must collect data on 4 key performance indicators (KPIs) to meet the [digital by default service standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default):

* [cost per transaction](/service-manual/measurement/cost-per-transaction.html)
* [user satisfaction](/service-manual/measurement/user-satisfaction.html)
* [completion rate](/service-manual/measurement/completion-rate.html)
* [digital take-up](/service-manual/measurement/digital-takeup.html)

If there are other metrics that will help you improve your service, measure those things too. Read our [guidance on KPIs specific to your service](/service-manual/measurement/other-kpis.html).

## What happens to your data

You will need to display the performance of your service publicly at [www.gov.uk/performance](/service-manual/measurement/performance-platform.html).

Use this data to [investigate how well a service is performing, and as a prompt for further investigation and testing](/service-manual/measurement/using-data.html).
