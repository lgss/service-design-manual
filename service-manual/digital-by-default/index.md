  <p>
    The Digital Service Standard has changed from <a href="/service-manual/digital-by-default-26-points/">26 points</a> to a more concise 18. From 1 June 2015 all transactional services will be assessed on the new 18 points.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Service Standard ensures digital teams build high quality government services.
  </p>

  <p>
    A transactional service must meet each criteria to pass the Government Digital Service assessment. If a service doesn’t pass it won’t appear on GOV.UK.
  </p>

  <p>
    Assisted digital support is an integral part of any service, helping users who can't complete the service on their own.
