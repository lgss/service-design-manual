GOV.UK Verify allows users to securely access digital government services, and makes sure that people using your service are who they say they are.
Eventually, if you're running a service that needs to know a user's identity, you'll have to use GOV.UK Verify, unless the user is a business or an agent, in which case you must use Government Gateway.

## Start using GOV.UK Verify

To start using GOV.UK Verify, you need to go through a 6-stage onboarding process.

[Find out how the onboarding process works](http://alphagov.github.io/identity-assurance-documentation/index/moveThroughProcess.html#gatereviewprocess).

This guidance is for people building government services, [find out more about GOV.UK Verify](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify/introducing-govuk-verify).
